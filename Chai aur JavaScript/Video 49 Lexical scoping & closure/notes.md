# 1. Lexical Scoping in JavaScript
Lexical scoping means that a function can access variables from the scope in which it was defined, not where it is executed. The scope is determined by the structure of the code (i.e., where functions are written), not by how they are called.

# 2. Closures in JavaScript
A closure is when a function remembers and continues to access variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has finished execution.
