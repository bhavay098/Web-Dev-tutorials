# What are props in react?
In React, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only and help make components reusable and dynamic.

**Key Features of Props:**

1. **Customizable** – Props allow you to configure a component differently each time it’s used.
2. **Can Pass Anything** – Props can be:
    - Strings, numbers, booleans
    - Arrays, objects
    - Functions (for communication between components)
    - Even other React components (as `children`)
