# üß† what is context API in React?
In React, the Context API is a built-in feature that allows you to share data across the entire component tree without passing props manually at every level.

## Why use Context API?
In a typical React app, data is passed from parent to child via props. But when many components need the same data (like a theme, user info, or language), this becomes cumbersome ‚Äî called "prop drilling".  
The Context API helps solve this by providing a way to "broadcast" data to multiple components directly.

# üîç What is `useContext` hook?
`useContext` is a React hook that lets your components read values from a context without needing to pass props manually.

## When and why to use it:
Use `useContext` when you have some global data (like user info, theme, language, etc.) that many components need ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt want to pass that data down through every level of the component tree.

**Syntax:**
```js
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

- `MyContext` is the context object you created with `createContext()`
- `value` is whatever value is currently provided by the nearest `<MyContext.Provider>`
