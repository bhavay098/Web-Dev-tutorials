# What is Express.js?
Express.js is a fast, minimal, and flexible Node.js web application framework. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. It's a framework built on top of Node.js for handling HTTP requests and responses. It simplifies and speeds up development compared to using plain Node.js. Express provides a server for handling HTTP requests. You define routes and what should happen when a request hits those routes.

# What is Versioning in Node.js?
versioning is how Node.js releases updates and improvements, and how they label those releases so developers know what changed, how big the change is & whether it might break existing apps.  
Node.js uses Semantic Versioning (often called SemVer).

**4.18.3 (Major.Minor.Patch)**

1st Part -> 4 (Major - Big changes, may break old code, update only when building a project from scratch)  
2nd Part -> 18 (Minor - New feature or security update, Recommended update)    
3rd Part -> 2 (Patch - Minor fixes, Optional update)

## What `^` Means in Versions (^4.17.9)?
`^` means:
- Allow updates that do not change the first digit.
- It allows updates to minor and patch versions,
- but not major updates (which could break things).

Here `^4.17.9` means:
- Minimum version: 4.17.9
- You can automatically install updates like
  - `4.18.0`
  - `4.19.5`
  - `4.20.1`
- But NOT updates to version 5.0.0 or above!

Because jumping from 4.x.x â†’ 5.x.x is a major version change and could break your app.

### The `~` symbol means:
- Allow only patch updates
- Only last number will be updated
- Do NOT allow minor or major updates

**No symbol means the version will remain fixed**
